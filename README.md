# Chain sampling plans

Producer risk in manufacturing is the probability that a good product will be rejected by a consumer because a bad batch was observed in a sample that has been tested. Due to the cost of manual quality check, often times we rely on checking the quality of products in samples, and consequtive samples and take a decision whether the lot of produced/manufactured items are acceptable to market/consumption.

Here we replicate the constibutions in chain sampling plans from research in academia and made available for consumtpion.
